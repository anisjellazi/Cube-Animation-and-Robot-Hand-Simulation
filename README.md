# Cube Animation and Robot Hand Simulation

A Python-based simulation that features animated cubes manipulated by a robot hand. The project uses the `Tkinter` library for GUI and animations, simulating cube stacking and placement on a table. This repository demonstrates how to control and animate objects in a virtual environment, providing users with interactive buttons to control the robot arm's actions.

## Features

- **Robot Hand**: The robot arm can pick up cubes and place them accurately on top of other cubes or on a table.
- **Cube Manipulation**: The robot can move cubes around with realistic animations, including picking, placing, and stacking cubes.
- **Dynamic Interface**: The GUI features interactive buttons for users to control the robot arm, making the simulation responsive to different actions.
- **Table Image**: A table is represented as an image, and cubes can be placed on it by the robot arm.
- **Cube Positioning**: Cubes can be moved between the table and other cubes, maintaining precise positioning during each animation.

## Requirements

To run the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included by default with Python)
- Pillow (`PIL`) for handling images

You can install the required package using:

```bash
pip install pillow
